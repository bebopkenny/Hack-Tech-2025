# GreenRoute

GreenRoute is a real-time eco-routing web application that helps users plan more sustainable trips. It compares carbon emissions between traditional driving, biking, and walking, giving users a clear way to reduce their environmental impact.

This project was created for the Caltech (California Institute of Technology) HackTech Hackathon.

## About the Project

GreenRoute was created to make sustainability more accessible to daily commuters. By visualizing the carbon emissions of different travel choices, the app encourages users to take greener alternatives whenever possible.

This project was built individually, requiring a deep dive into new technologies. Learning how to integrate and dynamically render routes using the Google Maps API was one of the major technical challenges. Chart.js was used to present carbon emission comparisons visually, making data easy to understand at a glance. The project design emphasizes simplicity, responsiveness, and clarity to fit real-world user needs.

## Key Features

- Interactive live map using Google Maps API
- Dynamic route generation and carbon emission analysis
- Eco-friendly trip alternatives with distance and estimated times
- Visualized COâ‚‚ savings with responsive Chart.js bar graphs
- Clean sidebar layout displaying trip summary and eco data
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users

## Challenges

One of the biggest learning curves was mastering the Google Maps JavaScript API, particularly the directions and places services. Integrating Chart.js to update dynamically based on user searches was another important step. Working solo meant careful time management between coding features and polishing the user interface. Building both the front-end logic and connecting all API services required balancing new learning with project delivery.

## Future Improvements

GreenRoute can be expanded by integrating automatic eco-location detection, such as nearby parks, farmers markets, and electric vehicle charging stations. Future versions would also include user authentication and allow personalized vehicle emission profiles, offering even more accurate carbon tracking. Additional improvements would focus on accessibility, mobile optimization, and smarter eco-routing suggestions.
